📌 Summary of Work Completed

In this SQL project, I performed a wide range of operations across 25+ relational tables to demonstrate strong command over SQL concepts. Below is everything implemented:

🔹 1. Applied All Types of Joins

Connected tables using INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, SELF, and CROSS JOINs to retrieve combined datasets, identify missing relationships, and generate analytical reports.

🔹 2. Implemented Subqueries

Used:

Scalar subqueries

Correlated subqueries

IN, EXISTS, ANY, ALL

Subqueries in WHERE and FROM

These helped answer deeper analytical questions like employees above average salary, customers with more than 5 orders, etc.

🔹 3. Utilized Built-in Functions

Applied:

String functions (UPPER, CONCAT, SUBSTRING)

Numeric functions (ROUND, FLOOR)

Date functions (YEAR, DATEDIFF)

Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)

These enhanced data formatting and calculations.

🔹 4. Created 5+ User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

Designed real-world functions:

Yearly salary calculator

Discount calculation

Grade classification

Stock value calculator

Age calculation

Loan calculator

These improved modularity and reusability.

🔹 5. Applied Cascade Rules

Set foreign key constraints with:

ON DELETE CASCADE

ON UPDATE CASCADE

Ensured referential integrity & automated child record updates.

🔹 6. Wrote Clean SQL with Proper Comments

All DDL, DML, and DQL queries include meaningful comments, improving readability and understanding.
